# Next.js Navigation Issue in Production

This repository demonstrates a strange navigation problem encountered in a Next.js application. The issue only manifests in the production build and not during development.

## Problem Description

The application has two pages: 'Home' and 'About'. A button on the 'About' page should navigate back to the 'Home' page using `router.push('/')`. However, in the production build, clicking this button has no effect.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run build` to build the application.
4. Run `npm start` to start the production server.
5. Navigate to `/about`.
6. Click the 'Go back to Home' button.  Observe that navigation doesn't occur.

In contrast, during development (`npm run dev`), the navigation works as expected.

## Potential Causes (Speculation)

Possible causes include:

* **Client-Side Routing Misconfiguration:** An issue with how Next.js handles client-side routing in the production environment.
* **Conflicting Libraries:** The problem may be due to some unexpected interaction with external libraries.
* **Build Process Error:** Some error during the build process that alters the application's behavior.

## Solution

The solution is in `solution.js`. It involves refactoring the About page to use `next/link` instead of `router.push()` for navigation. This makes the navigation happen on the client-side which is less dependent on the server-side.
